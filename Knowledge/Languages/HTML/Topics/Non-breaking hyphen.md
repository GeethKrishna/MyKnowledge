- Just like Non-breaking space (nbsp) we also have Non-breaking hyphen which will make sure or words stay together in a single line and not break into new lines. Represented as: &#8209;
- example (here we have same number of a's):
	- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <span> 12:30-pm </span>
	- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <span> 12:30&#8209;pm </span>
