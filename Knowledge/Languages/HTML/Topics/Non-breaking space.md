- This is used to provide space that will not break into a new line. This HTML entity is represented by `&nbsp;`.
- example (here we have same number of a's):
	- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <span> 12:30 pm </span>
	- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <span> 12:30&nbsp;pm </span> 
- This will make sure that there is a space between them but also makes sure that the 2 words are together in a single line.
- We can use these non-breaking spaces for preventing browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.
