## Day 1: Focused Literature Review and Planning

**Morning (4 hours)**

- Review core Kafka security documentation (focus exclusively on authorization model)
- Read 3-5 key papers/articles on Kafka security (prioritize Confluent docs, any academic papers)
- Create structured notes on key concepts, approaches, and limitations

**Afternoon (4 hours)**

- Compare existing RBAC implementations (Confluent, KSM) through their documentation
- Create a simple comparison table of features
- Draft a skeleton outline for your entire paper with section headings
- Create a writing schedule for the week with daily goals

## Day 2: Architecture Design and Implementation Planning

**Morning (4 hours)**

- Design simplified reference architecture for Kafka RBAC
- Create architectural diagrams showing:
    - Current Kafka security flow
    - Proposed enhanced RBAC model
    - Integration points with external systems

**Afternoon (4 hours)**

- Outline two implementation approaches:
    - Custom Authorizer (document class structure, key methods)
    - External Authorization Service (document components, interfaces)
- Create pseudocode for critical components
- Document constraints and assumptions

## Day 3: Implementation Focus

**Morning (4 hours)**

- Set up minimalist test environment (single Kafka broker with security enabled)
- Implement simplified version of Custom Authorizer approach:
    - Focus on core authorization logic
    - Implement basic role hierarchy
    - Write minimal tests for validation

**Afternoon (4 hours)**

- Implement prototype of External Authorization approach:
    - Set up basic OPA or custom authorization service
    - Create example policies
    - Document integration points
- Take screenshots and document configuration

## Day 4: Evaluation and Analysis

**Morning (4 hours)**

- Run basic performance tests on both implementations:
    - Measure authorization latency impact
    - Test with small set of roles and permissions
    - Document methodology and results
- Create visualization of performance data

**Afternoon (4 hours)**

- Conduct security analysis:
    - Identify core security properties of each approach
    - Document potential vulnerabilities
    - Propose mitigations
- Create comparative table of approaches

## Day 5: Case Study Documentation and Initial Draft

**Morning (4 hours)**

- Document step-by-step implementation for most promising approach:
    - Environment setup
    - Implementation steps with configuration examples
    - Validation procedures
- Create implementation checklist

**Afternoon/Evening (4-6 hours)**

- Begin drafting paper sections:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Literature review
    - Proposed architecture
- Focus on explaining concepts clearly with support from your diagrams

## Day 6: Complete Initial Draft

**Full Day (8-10 hours)**

- Complete remaining sections:
    - Implementation details
    - Evaluation results
    - Case study
    - Discussion of findings
    - Conclusion and future work
- Add references and citations
- Insert figures, tables, and code examples

## Day 7: Review and Refinement

**Morning (4 hours)**

- Complete comprehensive review of draft:
    - Check for technical accuracy
    - Ensure logical flow between sections
    - Verify all diagrams and tables are referenced
    - Check formatting consistency

**Afternoon (4 hours)**

- Make final revisions based on review
- Prepare submission package:
    - Final paper
    - Supporting materials (if required)
    - Code examples (if submitting separately)
- Submit initial draft

## Practical Tips for Success:

1. **Scope Management**:
    
    - Focus on depth rather than breadth
    - Prioritize one implementation approach if time gets tight
    - Use simplifications where appropriate but acknowledge them
2. **Research Efficiency**:
    
    - Use Confluent documentation as primary source
    - Focus on whitepapers rather than academic papers for faster review
    - Look for existing implementations on GitHub to accelerate understanding
3. **Implementation Shortcuts**:
    
    - Consider mockups instead of full implementations where appropriate
    - Use Docker containers for quick environment setup
    - Leverage existing code samples when possible
4. **Writing Approach**:
    
    - Write sections as you complete each day's work while it's fresh
    - Use bullet points initially, then expand to full paragraphs
    - Focus on clarity over stylistic perfection for the initial draft
5. **Resource Preparation**:
    
    - Bookmark all reference materials for quick access
    - Prepare templates for diagrams to speed creation
    - Set up citation management early (use Zotero or similar)

While this is an aggressive schedule, it focuses on producing the core content needed for your initial draft. The paper will benefit from further refinement after the initial submission, but this plan gives you a solid foundation within your one-week timeframe.****
