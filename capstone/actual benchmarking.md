## **Plan of Action for Implementing Performance Analysis and Benchmarking**

The goal of **Section 6: Performance Analysis and Benchmarking** is to evaluate how different RBAC implementations affect **Kafka’s security, performance, and scalability**. To achieve this, we will systematically compare three different authorization mechanisms:

1. **Kafka Native ACLs** (built-in role-based access control).
    
2. **Custom Authorization Plugin** (Java-based pluggable authorizer with database-backed policy storage).
    
3. **Centralized IAM-Based RBAC** (Keycloak + Open Policy Agent for fine-grained access control).
    

We will conduct benchmarking experiments using **real-world Kafka workloads**, measure key performance metrics, and analyze the trade-offs between security, performance, and manageability.

# **📌 Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Benchmarking Environment**

1. **Deploy Kafka Cluster**
    
    - Minimum **3 Kafka brokers** + **3 Zookeeper nodes**.
        
    - Configure default retention, partitions, and replication factors.
        
2. **Enable Security Features**
    
    - **SASL_SSL authentication** for secured client connections.
        
    - **SSL/TLS encryption** for broker-to-broker communication.
        
3. **Prepare Kafka Workloads**
    
    - **Producers:** Simulate real-time data ingestion with a constant message stream.
        
    - **Consumers:** Subscribe to topics with different partition distributions.
        
4. **Define Role-Based Policies**
    
    - **Basic Users:** Read-only access to topics.
        
    - **Power Users:** Read and write access.
        
    - **Admins:** Full control over topics and consumer groups.

### **Step 2: Implementing Authorization Mechanisms**

#### **1️⃣ Kafka Native ACL-Based RBAC**

**🔹 What to Implement?**

- Use Kafka's built-in **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** to define permissions at the **topic** and **consumer group** levels.
    
- Assign roles using the **kafka-acls.sh** command.
    
- Test authorization by restricting/allowing different users.
    

**🔹 Steps to Implement**

1. Enable **SASL_SSL authentication** in `server.properties`.
    
2. Add ACL rules:
    
    ```sh
    kafka-acls.sh --add --allow-principal User:alice --operation Read --topic sensitive-topic
    kafka-acls.sh --add --allow-principal User:bob --operation Write --topic sensitive-topic
    ```
    
3. Validate access by testing producer and consumer operations.
    

✅ **Expected Behavior:**

- Unauthorized users should get **Access Denied** errors.
    
- Role changes require **manual ACL updates**.
    

---

#### **2️⃣ Custom Kafka Authorization Plugin**

**🔹 What to Implement?**

- Build a **Java-based custom Authorizer** that integrates with an **RBAC policy database**.
    
- Store **role mappings in PostgreSQL** instead of using Kafka ACLs.
    
- Implement a **dynamic policy evaluation engine** to enforce access control rules.
    

**🔹 Steps to Implement**

1. Implement a **KafkaAuthorizer** class that extends Kafka’s security API.
    
2. Store **user-role mappings** in a PostgreSQL table:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
        role_name VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
        resource_type VARCHAR,
        resource_name VARCHAR,
        permission VARCHAR
    );
    ```
    
3. Implement a **cache-based policy lookup** for low-latency authorization.
    
4. Integrate with Kafka by modifying `server.properties`:
    
    ```properties
    authorizer.class.name=com.custom.RBACAuthorizer
    ```
    
5. Deploy and test authorization with dynamic role updates.
    

✅ **Expected Behavior:**

- Policies can be updated **without restarting Kafka**.
    
- **Better granularity** compared to ACLs.
    
- Increased latency due to **database lookups**.
    

---

#### **3️⃣ Centralized IAM-Based RBAC (Keycloak + OPA)**

**🔹 What to Implement?**

- Use **Keycloak** for **authentication and role management**.
    
- Use **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** for **fine-grained authorization**.
    
- Enforce **token-based access control** in Kafka clients.
    

**🔹 Steps to Implement**

1. Set up **Keycloak** and create **user roles (admin, producer, consumer)**.
    
2. Integrate **Keycloak JWT authentication** with Kafka clients.
    
3. Define **authorization policies** in OPA:
    
    ```rego
    package kafka.authz
    
    default allow = false
    
    allow {
        input.user_role == "producer"
        input.operation == "write"
    }
    ```
    
4. Deploy an **OPA sidecar proxy** to evaluate authorization policies.
    
5. Test **role-based access control** with JWT-based client authentication.
    

✅ **Expected Behavior:**

- **Centralized control** with an easy-to-manage UI.
    
- **Better scalability** than Kafka ACLs.
    
- **Higher latency** due to external policy evaluation.

# **📊 Key Performance Metrics to Measure**

## **6.1 Authorization Latency Comparison**

📌 **What to measure?**

- Time taken to **evaluate an authorization request** before Kafka allows or denies access.
    

📌 **How to measure?**

- Log **authorization decision timestamps** in Kafka.
    
- Measure latency for **100,000 access requests**.
    

📊 **Expected Results:**

- **Kafka ACLs → Fastest** (native implementation).
    
- **Custom Plugin → Moderate** (database lookup overhead).
    
- **Centralized IAM → Slowest** (external policy evaluation).

## **6.2 Throughput Impact Assessment**

📌 **What to measure?**

- Number of **messages/sec** processed under different RBAC models.
    

📌 **How to measure?**

- Use **Kafka Producer Performance Tool** to send **1M messages**.
    
- Measure impact of RBAC checks on **throughput reduction**.
    

📊 **Expected Results:**

- **Kafka ACLs → Minimal impact (~5% overhead)**.
    
- **Custom Plugin → Slight reduction (~10% overhead)**.
    
- **Centralized IAM → Significant impact (~20% overhead)**.

## **6.4 Resource Utilization Patterns**

📌 **What to measure?**

- **CPU, memory, and disk usage** during high-traffic operations.
    

📌 **How to measure?**

- Monitor **Kafka broker logs** and **system metrics** (Prometheus + Grafana).
    
- Identify **RBAC-related performance bottlenecks**.
    

📊 **Expected Results:**

- **Kafka ACLs → Least resource usage**.
    
- **Custom Plugin → Higher CPU due to DB queries**.
    
- **Centralized IAM → High memory and network usage**.
