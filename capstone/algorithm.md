#### 1. ACL implementation

- Configure Kafka brokers to enable SASL authentication.
- Configure ZooKeeper servers to enable SASL authentication.
- Create JAAS configuration files for Kafka brokers and ZooKeeper servers.
- Start ZooKeeper servers with SASL authentication enabled.
- Start Kafka brokers with SASL authentication enabled.
- Create SASL users and passwords in the Kafka broker configuration.
- Configure broker properties to require SASL authentication for all client connections.
- Write Python scripts using the kafka-python package to connect using SASL credentials.
- Set SASL mechanism, username, and password in the Python client connection settings.
- Connect the Python scripts to the Kafka cluster using the configured SASL authentication.
#### 2. custom java implementation

1. Design a database schema with a `users` table storing usernames, password hashes, and roles, and a `role_permissions` table storing roles and their permissions.
2. Insert sample user credentials and role-based permissions into the database.
3. Implement a `DbLoginCallbackHandler` class that connects to the database and validates username and password during authentication.
4. In the `DbLoginCallbackHandler`, fetch the user’s role from the database after successful authentication.
5. Implement a `DbAuthorizer` class that connects to the database and queries role-based permissions during authorization.
6. In the `DbAuthorizer`, fetch permissions based on the user’s role and match them against the requested Kafka operation.
7. Configure the Kafka broker to use the custom `DbLoginCallbackHandler` for SASL authentication.
8. Configure the Kafka broker to use the custom `DbAuthorizer` for role-based authorization.
9. Set up a Python Kafka client using the `kafka-python` library with SASL/PLAIN authentication enabled.
10. Connect the Python client to the Kafka broker by providing the username and password configured in the database.
11. Authenticate the client request against the database credentials using the `DbLoginCallbackHandler`.
12. Authorize the client request against the database permissions using the `DbAuthorizer`.
13. Allow or deny the client operation based on the dynamic role permissions fetched from the database.
14. Update user roles or permissions directly in the database without restarting the Kafka broker.
15. Dynamically apply the updated roles and permissions on new client requests through real-time database queries.
#### 3. OPA implementation

1. Client authenticates with the OAuth2 Authorization Server and obtains an access token.
2. Client sends the Kafka operation request along with the access token to the Proxy.
3. Proxy extracts the access token from the incoming request.
4. Proxy validates the access token by decoding and verifying the JWT signature locally or by introspecting with the OAuth2 Authorization Server.
5. Proxy constructs a request context from the token claims including user identity, roles, and permissions.
6. Proxy sends the request context to the Open Policy Agent (OPA) for authorization decision.
7. OPA evaluates the request against its policies and returns an allow or deny decision to the Proxy.
8. If the decision is deny, Proxy responds to the Client with an authorization error.
9. If the decision is allow, Proxy forwards the original Kafka request to the Kafka Broker.
10. Kafka Broker processes the forwarded request and generates a response.
11. Proxy receives the Kafka Broker response.
12. Proxy forwards the Kafka response back to the Client.
13. Client receives the final response of the Kafka operation.
